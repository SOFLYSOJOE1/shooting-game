# shooting-game
The provided code is an example of a simplified shooting game in C++ for Windows using the console window. The game consists of a player character, an enemy, and a bullet that the player can shoot. The objective is to shoot the enemy before it reaches the player.

The game screen is represented by ASCII characters, with the player represented by the '^' symbol, the bullet represented by the '|' symbol, and the enemy represented by the 'X' symbol. The player can move left and right using the 'a' and 'd' keys, respectively. Pressing the spacebar fires a bullet from the player's position towards the enemy.

The game loop continuously updates and redraws the game screen until the game is over. In each iteration of the loop, the game screen is cleared, and the updated positions of the player, bullet, and enemy are displayed. The player's input is processed to move the player character or fire a bullet. The game logic is updated to move the bullet upwards and check for collisions between the bullet and the enemy. If a collision occurs, the enemy is reset to a random position, and the bullet is reset. The enemy moves downwards towards the player, and if it reaches the player's position, the game is over.

The game utilizes functions like drawGameScreen() to display the game screen, processPlayerInput() to handle player input, and updateGameLogic() to update the game state. The Sleep() function is used to introduce a small delay between iterations to control the game speed.

It's important to note that this code is a basic demonstration and lacks many essential features of a complete shooting game, such as scoring, multiple levels, additional enemies, sound effects, and more advanced gameplay mechanics. However, it serves as a starting point for building a more complex and fully featured shooting game in C++.
